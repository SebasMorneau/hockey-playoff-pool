# Hockey Playoff Pool

A web application for managing hockey playoff pools among friends, family, or colleagues. This project allows users to create pools, draft NHL players, and track points based on real playoff performance.

## What is a Hockey Playoff Pool?

A hockey playoff pool is a fantasy sports game where participants draft NHL players who are participating in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Points are awarded based on real-world statistics of these players (goals, assists, wins for goalies, etc.), and the participant whose drafted team accumulates the most points wins the pool.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added here.
